##### Installation instructions #####

# Before installing the packages needed for this short workshop please be sure you have the adequate compilers. 

##### Windows #####

# If you are a Windows user, you will need "RTools". 
# To check if you have RTools installed, the simplest way is just to look at the installed software 
# by clicking on the Windows start button. Scroll down until R and see if there is an extra folder named RTools - Just that!!! 

# If you don't have RTools, download the package from here: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ 
# Always double-check which R version you are using. Further instructions are provided on the same webpage.

##### MAC ######

# If you are a Mac user you just need "Xcode". To check if you have installed Xcode on your Mac, use the following steps:

# Step 1. Open terminal 
# Step 2. type: xcodebuild -version 
# Step 2.1. if everything is OK then it will print the version of your Xcode

# If you don't have "Xcode" installed there are a couple of options but I strongly recommend installing Xcode using the terminal

# Step 1. Open terminal
# Step 2. type: xcode-select â€“install
# Step 2.1. Follow the instructions to complete the installation - this will take some time, please be patient.
# Step 3. To check if the installation was correct, open the terminal 
# Step 3.1. type: xcodebuild -version "or" xcode-select -p

# Hooray!!!
